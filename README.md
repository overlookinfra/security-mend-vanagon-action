# security-snyk-vanagon-action

This action runs snyk on generated gemfiles for vanagon builds.

### What this will identify
This tool will use the output of `vanagon inspect` in order to identify any gems pulled in from `rubygems.org`. It builds a pseudo Gemfile for each project and platform in the `configs` directory of a vanagon repository. It then creates a Gemfile.lock from the pseudo Gemfile and scans it with snyk.
